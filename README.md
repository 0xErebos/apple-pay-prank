# Apple Pay Prank Page

This is a simple prank page that **simulates an Apple Pay payment confirmation**.  
When you press the **‚ÄúReceive Payment‚Äù** button, it plays the Apple Pay chime and displays a realistic-looking payment received message ‚Äî just for fun.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This is NOT real Apple Pay. This doesn't charge anyone or process any actual transactions. It‚Äôs just a joke.

## üîß How It Works

- A button labeled **Receive Payment** triggers:
  - A payment chime (you need to provide your own sound file: `apple-pay.mp3`)
  - A fake payment message with a dollar amount and sender email

Looks best when opened on a smartphone or tablet ‚Äî great for messing with friends (responsibly!).
